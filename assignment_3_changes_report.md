**Features**:
- Upload specific checkpoints to Hugging Face repositories
- Support for phase-based organization
- Optional repository creation
- Flexible file naming and organization

**Reason for Creation**: Provides independent checkpoint management and sharing capabilities.

### 2. `create_hf_repo.py`

**Reason for Creation**: Provides debugging and verification capabilities for repository management.

## Training and Resume Functionality

### Phase-Based Training
The modifications enable training in distinct phases:
- **Phase 1**: Initial training with basic configuration
- **Phase 2**: Resumed training from Phase 1 checkpoints
- Each phase maintains separate checkpoint directories
- IoU progress is tracked and plotted for each phase
- Loss progress is tracked and plotted for each phase

### Checkpoint Management
- **Automatic Saving**: Checkpoints saved after every epoch
- **State Preservation**: Complete training state including optimizer, random states, Loss history and IoU history
- **Resume Capability**: Seamless training resumption from any checkpoint
- **Cloud Storage**: Optional upload to Hugging Face for backup and sharing

### Training Resumption
- **Full State Restoration**: Network weights, optimizer state, epoch number, and training statistics
- **Reproducible Training**: Random state preservation ensures consistent results
- **IoU Continuity**: Training progress visualization across resumed sessions
- **Loss Continuity**: Training progress visualization across resumed sessions

## Files Not Used in Training/Resuming

### Log Files and Checkpoints
- **Log files** (`*.log`): Used for debugging and monitoring but not directly in training logic
- **Checkpoint files** (`*.pth.tar`): Used for resuming but not modified in code
- **Images** (`*.png`): Generated plots for visualization but not used in training

### Reason for Non-Usage
These files are outputs of the training process rather than inputs, serving monitoring, debugging, and visualization purposes rather than being part of the core training logic.

## Summary

The modifications create a comprehensive training automation system that:
1. **Enables Phase-Based Training**: Organized training in distinct phases with separate checkpoint management
2. **Supports Training Resumption**: Complete state restoration for seamless training continuation
3. **Integrates Cloud Storage**: Optional Hugging Face integration for checkpoint backup and sharing
4. **Provides Progress Tracking**: IoU, Loss plotting and comprehensive logging
5. **Ensures Reproducibility**: Random state management for consistent results
6. **Optimizes Performance**: Reduced image sizes and improved data loading for efficient training

All changes are designed to work together as a cohesive system for automated, reproducible, and manageable training of the SeqTrack model on the LaSOT dataset with focus on book and coin object classes.
