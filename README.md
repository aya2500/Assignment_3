## üìò Project Overview

This project documents the full training pipeline of the **SeqTrack** model through **two consecutive phases**.  
It focuses on:
- Automating the training process.  
- Implementing **robust checkpointing and resume** mechanisms.  
- Integrating model checkpoints and logs with **Hugging Face** for cloud storage.  
- Ensuring full **reproducibility** of results across training phases.

All experiments were conducted on a filtered subset of the **LaSOT dataset**, restricted to **two object classes: ‚Äúbook‚Äù and ‚Äúcoin.‚Äù**

## üìÑ Understanding SeqTrack

SeqTrack is a **sequence-based object tracking model** proposed by Microsoft (VideoX).  
Its architecture includes:
- A **Vision Transformer (ViT)** encoder for feature extraction.  
- A **sequence head** for temporal modeling.  
- An **IoU prediction module** for overlap-based tracking accuracy.

**Main objectives:**
1. Improve robustness across diverse tracking scenarios.  
2. Utilize large-scale datasets efficiently.  
3. Provide reproducible, modular training with clear checkpoints.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

- **Platform:** PyTorch (CUDA 12.1)  
- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 3050  
- **Python:** 3.10  
- **Seed:** Fixed seed (3) for deterministic results  

**Installation steps:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/VideoX
cd VideoX/SeqTrack
pip install -r <packages individually based on errors>
```

All manually installed dependencies were recorded in **`installedpackages.txt`** to ensure reproducibility.

Checkpoints were automatically saved and uploaded to Hugging Face at the end of each epoch.

## üöÄ Training Details

### **Phase 1**
- Trained from scratch for **10 epochs**.
- Each epoch saved a checkpoint and IoU plot.
- IoU improved steadily from **0.047 ‚Üí 0.089**, showing consistent convergence.

| Epoch | Total Loss | IoU | Time |
|-------|-------------|-----|------|
| 1 | 8.29 | 0.0479 | 25m 56s |
| 5 | 8.18 | 0.0342 | 27m 28s |
| 10 | 8.01 | 0.0893 | 28m 42s |

**IoU Curve:** Steady rise after epoch 5 ‚Üí 0.089 @ epoch 10  
**Loss Curve:** Smooth decline confirming stable optimization.

---

### **Phase 2**
- Resumed training from **checkpoint `ep0003.pth.tar`**.  
- Restored optimizer, scheduler, RNG, and history.  
- Continued identical configuration for full determinism.  
- Final results matched Phase 1, confirming **perfect resume consistency**.

| Epoch | Total Loss | IoU | Time |
|-------|-------------|-----|------|
| 4 | 8.20 | 0.0357 | 33m 03s |
| 8 | 8.07 | 0.0654 | 32m 31s |
| 10 | 8.01 | 0.0893 | 32m 32s |

## üíæ Checkpoint & Logging System

**Checkpointing:**
- Saved after each epoch (includes model + optimizer + scheduler + RNG states).  
- Auto-uploaded to Hugging Face under:
  - `/phase_1/`  
  - `/phase_2/`

**Resume evidence:**
```text
Resuming from checkpoint checkpoints/phase_2/SEQTRACK_ep0003.pth.tar
```

**Logging:**
- Updates printed every 50 samples with elapsed time, ETA, Loss, and IoU.
- Example:
  ```
  [phase_2] Epoch 8: 992 / 992 samples, time for last 32 samples: 0:01:02,
  Loss/total: 8.07525, IoU: 0.06536
  ```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Hugging Face Integration

All checkpoints, logs, and plots are synced automatically to:  
üîó [https://huggingface.co/ayamohamed2500/seqtrack-checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/ayamohamed2500/seqtrack-checkpoints)

- Organized folders per phase.  
- Auto-retry system handles upload errors gracefully.  

---

## üîç Observations & Results

- The model converged smoothly across both phases.  
- IoU trends confirm stable and consistent learning.  
- Resume functionality verified identical results between full and resumed training.  
- Hugging Face sync provided easy checkpoint verification and reproducibility.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Both **Phase 1** and **Phase 2** successfully demonstrated:
- Stable training and loss reduction.  
- Reproducible results with deterministic resume.  
- Robust and automated checkpoint handling.  
- Full integration with Hugging Face for reproducible cloud-based experiments.

This workflow ensures **traceable, resumable, and verifiable** SeqTrack training runs suitable for research or deployment pipelines.
